# Recent Projects by Ian Handshy
## Here are a few pages I've built for Ergodyne.com

Page URLs:
* [Product Launch Landing Page - Advanced Lead Nurturing](https://www.ergodyne.com/skoll)
  * To help nurture new sales qualified leads, this web form activates required fields depending on user selections. On the back-end of this form, prior to posting the data to our DB, the client-side logic checks the user's selection and assigns a sales associate based on territory.
* [Bosch Partnership Micro-site](https://www.ergodyne.com/bosch)
  * In partnership with Bosch Power Tools, I created a micro-site to showcase some of our cross promotions. A few features requested by our designers were: video background banner, animated arrow to activate scroll, a tiled layout for extended content as the campaign progressed.
* [Custom Product, Get Quote](https://www.ergodyne.com/custom-multi-band.html)
  * To launch a new customization service, we wanted to create a quote page for our vendors that featured product information, the supply timeline, product video, and an FAQ section.
* [Tool Tethering Selector](https://www.google.com)
  * The goal for this page was to showcase an advanced product solution and provide sellers with how-to â€“videos and other product focused literature/content.
* [Winter Gear Guide](https://www.ergodyne.com/winter-gear-guide-sign-up.html)
  * To showcase Ergodyne's winter seasonal products, I created a new section of the website to drive traffic for several seasonal campaigns. This 'Winter Gear Guide' promotes new products from our 2016-2017 catalog. This page also featured a giveaway sign-up, which has since ended - so the sign-up form has been removed.
* [Annual Golf Tournament](https://www.ergodyne.com/65-roses-sign-up)
  * For an annual golf tournament hosted by Ergodyne, I built out a content section to direct users to get information, request an RSVP and to submit donations.
